Mobile apps have become the most powerful tool in the world today to gain easy access to potential customers. Building an eye - catching, impressive and aesthetically designed app for maximum response from users is extremely positive.



The two important things that are extremely important to the design of an application are the user experience(UX) and the user interface(UI), so when it comes to developing a mobile app. Here are 10 tips that can help boost conversions through your mobile app designs.



**KEEP AN IMPRESSIVE UI:** It's preferable to an app that has a heavy text design with a good, impressive, delightful look. To retain existing users, an excellent user interface is a must.



**USE CLOORS AND LOGOS ATTRACTIVE:** A brand is entirely focused on your relationship with a specific service or product. The choice of a good color is very subtle and efficient in defining this relationship.

**
****MAINTAIN CONSISTENCE IN ELEMENTS:** Consistance in defining and repeating the app's elements is extremely important. If one of the buttons says that "subscribe" is in a certain color say yellow, then all buttons of that color should be yellow. This is something that all screens should maintain.



**GIVE FAST FEEDBACK:** All users expect their phones to respond effectively to their entire interaction, and each interaction needs to provide proper feedback. For example, if a user performs an action, reacts with an animation, then it gives the user feedback about the process.



**USE GOOD TYPOGRAPHY:** Good typography is extremely important because it has a major influence on different aspects of an app that include reading, mood, usage experience, etc. To create a pleasant design, different typographical principles must be understood.



**INVOLVE REAL USERS:** Real users should be involved when assessing their ideas and opinions in connection with UI design. This should be done in an early stage of development in order to reduce confusion in relation to the characteristics which should be included and which can be let go.

**STICK TO THE OS GUIDELINES:** It is important to keep to several user instructions relating to the targeted operating system when developing an app's user interface.



**BEWARE OF METAPHORS:** Few Graphic metaphors are not technically available, such as analog images (TV screens, radio and cameras). So it is necessary to avoid these metaphors.

**FUNCTIONALITY FOCUS:** The more complex the app, the harder it can be used or browse. Please consider dividing the feature into a number of related applications, each with a core functionality focus if you can offer more.

**USE MOTIONS AND TRANSITIONS:** To enhance the user experience of the app and show users the value rather than push it to view it use Motions and transitions . Application motions and transitions are very necessary to increase your conversion.
