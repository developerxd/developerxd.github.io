The big players in the market and development frameworks-Flutter and React Native have become top competitors competing to demonstrate their worth across mobile app growth across platforms. People who are looking to create applications faster at lower cost scratch their heads as they find it highly hard to determine which framework suits their app concept best.



In this article, we have discussed the most important points of comparison, which will assist you to obtain insights into the choices.



What is Flutter and React Native? A Sneak Peek

Flutter is a mobile app SDK that enables you to write an app and build a single database into Android and iOS OR use this toolkit to create mobile, Web, and desktop apps that are natively compiled from a single codebase. It is a mobile application SDK.



React is a JavaScript framework by Facebook that is used for the writing of authentic, native iOS and Android mobile apps.



**Comparison Factors**



- Testing Support:
  React Native utilizes JavaScript as a programming language commonly used by web developers, making it simple to embrace. While Flutter utilizes Dart programming language that is rarely used and less common in the developer community, React takes the lead through which we can readily conclude.
- Community Support:
  React Native uses JavaScript Bridge for contacting the native modules and, on the contrary, Flutter offers all those native components necessary in order to develop apps in the Flutter Engine or within the context itself.
- When not to Choose:
  Because of their one codebase and component-rich nature, Flutter apps look good across all OS versions, which means the app will behave naturally and copy its native components, while the application components of Native look just like the native ones.
- Time to Market:
  React is naturally faster in development but a little less flutter. In view of this, the bridge and the native elements are used and each platform needs to be optimised separately and increase the time to develop.
- User Interface:
  When your app is platform-specific, requires a wide variety of interactions with an OS, minimal user interface needs, especially with mobile hardware. You should opt for the growth of indigenous apps, whereas if your app needs custom communication via Bluetooth, you need to manage some complicated task in the background and you're looking to create an Android-only app, so you should definitely go for the growth of indigenous apps. Because it's useful for developing iOS apps.
- Technical Architecture:
  React has become significantly more popular since it started much earlier than Flutter, but it is still in its infancy in the increasing community. It's a new development.
- Programming Language :
  The community of React Natives does not support UI testing and integration officially. It utilizes third-party instruments such as Detox and Appium, while Flutter has a range of testing capabilities such as widget-testing which is much greater than React.



Definitively, flutter is still naïve but is working actively to improve its stability and many applications are being built with Flutter, some of them being Alibaba's Xianyu app, Google Ads app, JD finance app, Hamilton app, etc. And React Native's famous applications include Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Skype, Tesla, Wix, etc.
