The first question that runs in the minds of  business owners who still don't own an app is "how to get an idea  developed to an app?" In the midst of all developments and technological  disruptions, mobile app solutions are what came and remained. The world  has seen an unprecedented increase in the use of mobile apps over the  past few years and this has strengthened the development of mobile apps  for businesses, individuals and start-ups.



This article  will help you if you develop a smart and at once intimidating app for  you. It provides a final guide to the development of a full scale app.  The step-by-step process of developing an application right from the  start is explained here. It shows the best way how to turn a big app  idea into a reality.





1. **Deep market analysis and research:** 
   
    Any new venture concerning massive investments should start with a deep   analysis of the market and show that its idea will be fruitful in  sales.  How many users can an app achieve success depends on how many.  To  achieve this, you have to investigate the market in order to  identify  the characteristics of your target audience (such as  demographics,  people, gender), competitiveness, and app stores  trending.
2. **Intricate planning:** 
    The second step involves creating a detailed  app plan that includes all  the necessary features, brand elements for  CTAs and additional  features. The planning process must begin by  determining the objectives  of the app and necessary user actions. The  app consultants then map  how everything in the app looks and translates  the objectives into  different tasks.
    
3.  **Wireframing:**
    
    The next step is the app design, beginning with the icon  on each page.  It's never advisable to saw prototype design straight  away. Have a  sketch of all in a paper known as the wireframing, instead.  Wireframe  all the app, from layout, onboard pages, home screen, menu  view, the  CTA button notifications page and the pen and paper logo. This  helps  designers and developers in the next step to better know the   functionality of the app, arrange and design user interface components   accordingly.
    
4. **UI designing &amp; Prototyping:**
    After the wireframe has been completed, the  application is developed to  create an interface where the design team  works to get a look and feel  for the app. They design the interface by  analyzing the entire  wireframe of the app, its fundamental architecture,  components and user  interactions.
    
    Once design mockups  are ready, the team needs a plan for developing the  app with developers '  estimates, costs and time. You must then prepare  a clickable prototype  using any prototype tool.
    
5. **Development:**
    After the prototyping, the actual app development  process begins with  the professional software engineers who have  inherent knowledge and  skills. A concrete timetable, resources and costs  required means that  additional development costs are less likely to be  required. In  addition, a team monitors and evaluates every stage in the  development  process so that errors can be identified and so that  developers can  correct them immediately. This improves the time the  final product is  delivered.
    
6. **QA and Testing:** 
    The app is then transferred to the Quality Assessment (QA)  after  complete and final development, to ensure that it is completely   bug-free. The QA is performed in two phases: one is preliminary and the   other functional. While phase one decides on the target devices of the   app and future QA requirements, phase one evaluates all key functions. 
    
    All The test documentation defining the testing  requirements and the  number of test equipment needed will be prepared  after QA. This phase  helps to locate and correct bugs before release.







The process of development here  ends. This doesn't mean, however, that you're done. To launch and  promote the application on all Web and digital platforms, you need to  get an ideal marketing team. You must also ensure that the app is  consistently performed and that all the service support and maintenance  services never exceed the expectations of its users.
